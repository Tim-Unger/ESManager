# ESUpdater ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Tim-Unger/esupdater/total)

A Program to easily and quickly update your EuroScope Sectorfiles, with many Settings and Options to customize your Setup

## The Idea

Because it is very tedious to manually update your EuroScope Sectorfiles with every Airac-Cycle, also having to manually adjust personal Settings 
and needing to add Custom Plugins constantly I came up with the idea to create a Program that automatically sets up your EuroScope SectorFiles for you.

## What the Program does

The program is a simple tool to quickly update your EuroScope Sector-files without having to manually edit or copy lots of files.
Some features are:
- The ability to create a "plugin-collection" to automatically add your favorite plugins to every Sector-File
- 4 different modes of copying for even more flexibility and to fit every users setup
- The ability to create custom profiles for Settings to set up your Sector-Files even quicker and easier
- An "Easy-Mode" which takes you through the process step-by-step
- Lots of customisability to fit (almost) every user
- TopSky-Settings included
- Notifications if a new Airac is released
- Automatically detects the Airac of a Sector-File (If the Provider is AeroNav)
- 
- The possibility for vACCs to upload their custom Profiles to give users a quick way of installing the ideal EuroScope-Setup
- A quick and easy setup
- A light and resource-friendly program
- A Log that saves every File and Setting copied and used to give the user maximum transparency
- 
- once implemented, the ability to fully automatically download the new Sector-File, unzip it, moving it to your EuroScope-Directory, editing the Settings to fit your Setup (Not yet implented)

 ## Walk-Through of the Process
 
 ## Profiles
 You can create custom JSON-Files that can be loaded as a Profile to quickly import and display all Settings you want to use.
 To Create a Profile you can either manually write a JSON-File (see ProfileExample.json either in the Program directory or click [here](http://tim-u.me/ProfileExample.json))
 or you can Open ProfileCreator.exe which will guide you through the Process of Creating a Profile.
 You can also create a New JSON inside ESUpdater by activating "Create Profile with Settings" in "Other Settings" and selecting a Path
