# ESUpdater ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Tim-Unger/esupdater/total)

A Program to easily and quickly update your EuroScope Sectorfiles, with many Settings and Options to customize your Setup

## The Idea

Because it is very tedious to manually update your EuroScope Sectorfiles with every Airac-Cycle, also having to manually adjust personal Settings 
and needing to add Custom Plugins constantly I came up with the idea to create a Program that automatically sets up your EuroScope SectorFiles for you.

## Download

Simply head over to the Releases Page on this GitHub-Page or click [here](https://github.com/Tim-Unger/ESUpdater/releases/latest)

## Installation

Once downloaded, execute the Installer which will guide you through the Installation-Process.
Two Programs will be installed, the Main ESUpdater and a ProfileCreator (see [Creating Profiles](#Profiles))

 ## The Program

 ## Walk-Through of the Process
 
 ## Profiles
 You can create custom JSON-Files that can be loaded as a Profile to quickly import and display all Settings you want to use.
 To Create a Profile you can either manually write a JSON-File (see ProfileExample.json either in the Program directory or click [here](http://tim-u.me/ProfileExample.json))
 or you can Open ProfileCreator.exe which will guide you through the Process of Creating a Profile.
 You can also create a New JSON inside ESUpdater by activating "Create Profile with Settings" in "Other Settings" and selecting a Path
